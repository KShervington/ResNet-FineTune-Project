## Important Files
`src\model\fine_tune_resnet.ipynb` The main Jupyter notebook for working with the model.</br>
`src\preprocessing\delete_to_n.py` A python script that deletes all files in a target directory until the number of files reaches a certain number **_n_**. It was used to reduce the size of the dataset, evenly, for faster training.</br>
`src\preprocessing\map_class_names.py` A python script that converts (change the image and folder names) the dataset's native surface condition classes into OpenStreetMap (OSM) surface smoothness classes. Here is the mapping for conversion:
| RSCD Class Name | OSM Class Name |
| --- | --- |
| smooth | good |
| slight | intermediate |
| severe | bad |

</br>

`src\preprocessing\reorganize_data.py` A python script that organizes a list of images into their respective dataset folders. This was created because the 'test' and 'validation' data of the RSCD dataset came as a folder with images from all different classes mixed together. The 'train' part of the dataset was organized and the script follows the same type of categorization.
